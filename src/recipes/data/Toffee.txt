Tags: dessert

Ingredients:
- 1 c. sugar
- 1 c. butter
- 1/4 c. water
- 1 c. semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 finely chopped pecans

Directions:
- In 2-qt. saucepan heat sugar, water and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium and cook to 300 degrees on candy thermometer, stirring constantly (mixture will turn light brown when cooked). Immediately pour onto *stoneware* baking pan or pizza stone and spread to 1/4" thickness (mixture will not be very fluid). Sprinkle with chocolate; let stand about 1 minute or until chips are softened, then spread evenly over toffee. Sprinkle with nuts and refrigerate until firm.

Yield: About 36 pieces

Comments: Good luck not ruining your pan if you don't put this on stoneware; the toffee will harden incredibly. We only broke it up by jabbing with a knife. It's well worth the effort, though!
