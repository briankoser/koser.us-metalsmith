- 1/2 tsp. pepper

- shredded cheddar cheese to taste

Directions:
- Prick potatoes with fork and bake in microwave on High for 7-9 minutes, or until knife slides easily in. Halve each potato lengthwise, scoop out flesh and leave skins intact.

Comments: These are the best baked potatoes ever! Don't leave out a single ingredient, as they all combine for that "WOW" flavor. Potatoes can also be prebaked in oven for 1 hour at 375 degrees.
