Ingredients:
- 1 1/3 c. flour
- 3 Tbsp. cocoa
- 1/4 c. sugar
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 3 Tbsp. butter, melted
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 1 1/4 c. milk
- 1 egg
- 1/2 c. miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
- In medium bowl whisk dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients and stir (do not overmix). Stir in chocolate chips. Heat griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter.

Comments: For extra chocolate awesomeness, serve with the following ganache: 3/4 c. heavy cream, 1 tsp. butter, 1 c. mini semisweet chocolate chips. Heat cream and butter in small saucepan until just on the cusp of boiling, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and pour over mini chips in small bowl. Let rest a minute, then stir until completely combined.
