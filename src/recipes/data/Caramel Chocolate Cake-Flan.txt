Name: Caramel Chocolate Cake-Flan

Ingredients:
- 1/2 c. Smucker's caramel topping
- 4 oz. cream cheese, softened
- 4 large eggs
- 14 oz. sweetened condensed milk
- 12 oz. evaporated milk
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 1 box devils' food cake mix
- ingredients for mix

Directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 12-cup fluted tube pan and place a piece of rolled-up foil in tube of pan (prevents cake from baking over top). Pour caramel into bottom of pan.
- In blender, mix together cream cheese, eggs, milks and vanilla. In bowl, prepare cake mix according to package directions. Pour cake mix over caramel, then top with flan mix.
- Grease a piece of foil, then cover pan with coated side down. Place tube pan in large roasting pan, then add hot water to depth of 2". Bake 1 1/2 hours, or until toothpick in center still has a few moist crumbs. Place tube pan on cooling rack; cool 15 minutes. Remove foil. Place *large* plate on top of pan, top with cooling rack and invert; let cool 1 hour at room temperature. Cover and chill 4 hours, or overnight.

Yield: 8 large slices, or 16 party slices

Comments: This is very easy, and looks/tastes great! People who don't normally care for flan will like it. During bake time cake will rise to the top of the pan, becoming very moist as it passes through the flan.
