Name: Mom Koser's Chocolate Clay and Roses

Ingredients:
- 1/3 c. light corn syrup
- 1 pkg. semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
- Melt chocolate in double boiler, or over low heat. Stir in corn syrup; mixture will thicken and be difficult to stir. Move to cutting board or counter to mix completely. Cover with waxed paper to cool (overnight if possible); it should be soft and pliable. Will harden over time, but just knead to soften.
- To make roses: Make 10 small balls for petals. With first ball, flatten then roll into Teepee shape. Flatten others, gradually making them larger, and wrap around teepee to form petals. Continue until rose is desired shape.

Yield:
