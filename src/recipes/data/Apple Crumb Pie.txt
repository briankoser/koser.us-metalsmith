Filling Ingredients:
- 5-7 c. peeled, sliced Granny Smith apples (4 apples=about 6 cups)
- 1/2 c. sugar
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
Crust Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 c. flour
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 1/2 tsp. sugar (optional)

- 2 Tbsp. milk
Topping Ingredients:
- 1/2 c. sugar
- 3/4 c. flour
- 1/3 c. slightly cold butter

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- For filling, mix all ingredients and allow to sit while working on crust (the sugar will make the apples a little juicier).
- For crust, mix flour, salt and sugar. Add butter and milk at once, stirring to combine. Pat mixture into 9" or 9.5" pie pan with heel of your hand. Add filling.
- For topping, mix together flour and sugar, then cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Pat over apples and bake one hour.
