Name: Non-Alcoholic Eggnog

Ingredients:
- 6 egg yolks
- 1/2 c. sugar
- 1 c. heavy cream
- 2 c. milk
- 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
- Whisk egg yolks and sugar in bowl until light and creamy; set aside. In saucepan over medium-high heat combine cream, milk, nutmeg and salt. Stir often until mixture reaches a bare simmer. Add a big spoonful of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking vigorously. Repeat, adding a big spoonful at a time, to temper the eggs. Once all of the hot milk has been added to the eggs, pour the mixture back into the saucepan on the stove. Whisk constantly until mixture reaches 160 degrees on a thermometer. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Serve warm or cold. Store in fridge.

Yield: About 2 1/2 cups

Comments: Although this doesn't make very much it's way better than store-bought eggnog, and a little goes a long way--it's very rich!
