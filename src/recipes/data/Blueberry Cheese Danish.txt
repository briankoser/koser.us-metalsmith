Name: Blueberry Cheese Danish

Dough Ingredients:
- 3/4 c. cottage cheese
- 1/3 c. sugar
- 1/3 c. milk
- 1/4 c. oil
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 2 c. flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt

Filling Ingredients:
- 4 oz. cream cheese
- 1/4 c. sugar
- 1 egg, separated
- 1 tsp. grated lemon peel
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 1 c. fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw)
- 1 Tbsp. water

Glaze Ingredients:
- 1/2 c. powdered sugar
- 2 tsp. lemon juice

Directions:
- In blender, process cottage cheese until smooth. Add sugar, milk, oil and vanilla; process until smooth. In separate bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt; and cheese mixture. Mix (with mixer?) just until dough forms a ball. Turn onto a floured surface and knead 4-5 times. Place in bowl; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
- In mixing bowl beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add egg yolk, lemon peel and vanilla; mix well. Cut parchment paper into 17x13" strip; turn refrigerated dough onto it and roll into a 16x12" rectangle. Transfer parchment with danish to a baking sheet.
- Spread cream cheese mixture lengthwise in a 3 1/2" strip down center of dough; sprinkle with blueberries. On each side, cut 1" wide strips about 3 3/4" into center. Fold alternating strips at an angle across berries. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Beat egg white and water; brush over dough.
- Bake at 400 degrees for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack. Combine glaze ingredients and drizzle over warm pastry. Refrigerate leftovers.
