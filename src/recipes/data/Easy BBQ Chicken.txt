Name: Easy BBQ Chicken

Ingredients:
- 15 pieces chicken
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 3/4 c. packed brown sugar
- 1 c. ketchup
- 3 Tbsp. vinegar*
- 2 Tbsp. mustard
- cooked rice

Directions:
- Arrange chicken in 9x13" pan. Turn oven to broil and broil chicken 15 minutes on each side. Meanwhile combine all remaining ingredients and mix well. If desired, drain chicken juices, then pour BBQ sauce over chicken. Cover and bake at 300 degrees for 35 minutes; uncover and bake 10 minutes more. Serve over cooked rice.

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: I used 1 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar and 2 Tbsp. white vinegar. I broiled the chicken in the morning and then refrigerated it until the evening, when I baked it; saved a little time before dinner.
