Name: Festive Peppermint Marshmallows

Ingredients:
- butter and powdered sugar
- 2 1/2 Tbsp. unflavored gelatin
- 1/2 c. cold water
- 1 1/2 c. granulated sugar
- 1 c. corn syrup
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/2 c. water
- 1 tsp. peppermint extract

Directions:
- Rub cold butter over the bottom and sides of a glass baking dish (8x12"), then coat lightly with powdered sugar. In large bowl, sprinkle gelatin on 1/2 c. cold water to soften; set aside.
- In 2-qt. saucepan, heat granulated sugar, corn syrup, salt and water over low heat, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved. Heat to boiling; cook without stirring to 250 degrees on candy thermometer. Remove from heat.
- Slowly pour syrup into softened gelatin while beating with electric mixer on high speed. Beat until mixture is white; add peppermint extract and continue to beat until it has almost tripled in volume (if it starts climbing up your beaters, it's time to stop beating). Quickly pour into pan, scraping bowl clean; mixture will become too sticky if you don't move fast. Dust top with powdered sugar and let sit uncovered at least 8 hours.
- Run a knife around edges of pan to loosen marshmallow mixture, then invert onto cutting board; if necessary, use rubber spatula to loosen bottom. Using a pizza cutter, cut marshmallow into squares. Coat cutter with powdered sugar repeatedly while cutting. Dip the cut sides of marshmallows in powdered sugar so they won't be sticky anymore.
- Store in airtight container at room temperature up to 3 weeks.

Yield: 36 squares

Comments: Some flavor variations (I've only tried the vanilla and cocoa): Substitute 1 tsp. vanilla for the peppermint. Or, beat 1/8-1/4 c. cocoa into marshmallow mix and add cocoa to powdered sugar coating. Or, sprinkle 1 1/2 c. toasted flaked coconut on bottom and top of marshmallows; add 1/4 tsp. coconut flavoring to marshmallow mix. Or, melt chocolate and add to mixture while beating. Food coloring can also be added with the extract (blue goes nice with the peppermint for a Christmas look). If made in a 9x13" pan, marshmallows will be thin and can be cut with cookie cutters. These are a little work, but they can't be compared with store-bought marshmallows and they are great with hot chocolate. They are a Christmas tradition of mine.
