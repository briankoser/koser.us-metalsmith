Name: Nutella S'mores Fudge

Tags: easy Christmas dessert

Ingredients:
- 1 c. butter
- 1 c. nutella
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 3 1/2 c. powdered sugar
- 1/2-1 c. halved mini marshmallows
- 1/4 c. crushed graham crumbs

Directions:
- Line an 8x8" pan with parchment, leaving a little hanging over so you can lift fudge out later. In large microwaveable bowl melt butter with nutella for about 2 minutes. Stir and microwave another 1-2 minutes; mixture should be creamy but not hardening. Take out and stir. Mix in vanilla, powdered sugar and marshmallow bits. Pour into prepared pan and spread evenly. Sprinkle graham crumbs on top and refrigerate 1-2 hours to set up. Cut into squares. Store room temperature or in fridge.

Yield: 20-30 squares

Comments: This keeps longer in the fridge, but tastes better (in my opinion) at room temperature.
