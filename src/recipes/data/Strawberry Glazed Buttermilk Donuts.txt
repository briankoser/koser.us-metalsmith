Tags: breakfast

Ingredients:
- 2 c. flour
- 1/2 c. + 2 Tbsp. sugar, divided
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 3/4 c. buttermilk
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 c. honey
- 2 Tbsp. butter, melted
- 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 c. strawberries, diced and divided
- 1 c. powdered sugar

Directions:
- Heat oven to 425 degrees and lightly grease a donut pan. Combine 1/2 c. diced strawberries with 2 Tbsp. sugar; stir and mash with a fork, letting sit at room temperature until strawberry juice is produced. Add 2-3 Tbsp. of this juice to powdered sugar and mix well to make strawberry glaze (add more juice or powdered sugar to thin/thicken the glaze as desired). Set aside.
- In large bowl combine flour, 1/2 c. sugar, baking powder and salt and whisk until combined. In separate medium bowl whisk buttermilk, eggs, honey, butter and vanilla. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Fold in 1 c. strawberries. Pipe mixture into prepared donut pan and bake 8 minutes, or until inserted toothpick comes out clean (donuts may not rise much). Remove donuts from pan to wire rack and let cool 5 minutes, then dip in glaze. Serve immediately.

Yield: 12 donuts

Comments: These are a bit of work, but they're very tasty. They taste good even without the glaze, fantastic with.
