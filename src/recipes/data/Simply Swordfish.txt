Ingredients:
- swordfish steaks, at least 1" thick
- lemon juice
- dill and lemon pepper seasoning, to taste

Directions:
- Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place swordfish on baking sheet and brush both sides with lemon juice. Sprinkle both sides with seasonings and bake for roughly 15 minutes, or until fish flakes when poked with a fork. Fish will not flake as delicately as other fish when done.

Yield: 

Comments: Use fresh fish if possible; the flavor is that much better. This goes great with a side of corn, some fruit (Bing cherries?) and milk.
