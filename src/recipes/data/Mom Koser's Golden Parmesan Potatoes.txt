Name: Mom Koser's Golden Parmesan Potatoes

Tags: side crowd

Ingredients:
- 6 large potatoes
- 1/4 c. sifted flour
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. pepper
- 1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese
- 1/3 c. butter

Directions:
- Peel and quarter potatoes. Combine flour, salt, pepper and cheese in Ziploc bag. Moisten potatoes with water and shake in bag to cover.
- Melt butter in 9x13" pan. Place potatoes in pan and bake about 1 hour at 375 degrees. Turn once during baking.

Yield: 

Comments: Melissa Koser's change = I sliced the potatoes into chips rather than quarterring and people raved. If done this way, only 3 potatoes are needed, and 4 Tbsp. butter should be melted in an 8x12" pan in addition to the 9x13" pan.
