Ingredients:
- 1/2 c. pineapple juice from 20 oz. can
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 c. red wine vinegar, or apple cider vinegar
- 1 1/2 c. sugar
- 6 Tbsp. ketchup
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 Tbsp. soy sauce
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. each red pepper and ginger
- 4-6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 1/2 c. flour
- 1 1/3 c. cornstarch
- 1/2 tsp. each garlic powder and salt
- 1/4 tsp. each pepper, ginger, and onion powder
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 2-3 carrots, sliced *very* thinly
- 1 (20 oz.) can pineapple tidbits in juice
- 5 c. cooked rice, to serve

Directions:
- In medium saucepan combine all ingredients from pineapple juice to red pepper and ginger. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Let simmer 20 minutes to allow flavors to blend, stirring occasionally. Sauce will not thicken.
- Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9x13" baking pan. Place flour in large Ziploc bag; set aside. In medium bowl stir together cornstarch and remaining seasonings; set aside. Coat chicken with beaten eggs, allowing excess to drip off, then remove to floured Ziploc bag. Seal and shake to evenly coat chicken, then discard excess flour. Add cornstarch mixture to bag, seal and shake to coat. Pour enough olive oil into large skillet to generously coat bottom. Turn heat to high. When oil is hot and rippling, add chicken and cook 1-2 minutes per side until browned but not cooked through. Transfer chicken to prepared baking dish.
- Add peppers, carrots and pineapple to sweet and sour sauce and mix. Pour over chicken and stir until combined. Bake uncovered for 50 minutes until most of the sauce is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Serve over rice.

Yield: Serves 6-8
