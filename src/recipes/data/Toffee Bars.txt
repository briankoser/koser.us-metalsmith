Name: Toffee Bars

Tags: dessert

Ingredients:
- 1 c. butter, softened
- 1 c. packed brown sugar
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 c. flour
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 2/3+ c. semisweet chocolate chips (I added more till the top of the bars were covered)
- 1/2 c. chopped nuts

Directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees. In large bowl stir butter, brown sugar, vanilla and egg yolk until well mixed. Stir in flour and salt. Press dough in 13x9" pan or cookie sheet. Bake 25-30 minutes or until very light brown (crust will be soft). Immediately sprinkle with chocolate. Let stand about 5 minutes or until soft, then spread evenly. Sprinkle with nuts. Cool 30 minutes in pan on wire rack.

Yield: About 32 bars

Comments: This is the cookie version of toffee. You may want each for different occasions so I thought I'd include both.
