Name: Loaded Potato Slices

Ingredients:
- baking potatoes
- melted butter
- salt
- cooked, crumbled bacon (or bacon bits)
- chopped green onion
- shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and grease it; set aside. Wash potatoes and cut off ends; discard ends. Cut the rest of the potato into approximately 1/2" slices. Brush both sides and edges of potatoes with butter and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and bake 15 minutes. Flip each slice and bake another 15-25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Top with bacon, onion and cheese and bake 3-5 minutes more, or until cheese is bubbly.

Comments: Fantastic side dish, excellent for potlucks! I didn't include amounts as the recipe is very flexible, and can make a little or a lot depending on what you desire. 5 smallish potatoes yielded about 30 slices for me.
