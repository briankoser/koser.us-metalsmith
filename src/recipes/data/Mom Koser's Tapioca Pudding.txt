Name: Mom Koser's Tapioca Pudding

Ingredients:
- 2 c. milk
- 3 Tbsp. tapioca
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 4 Tbsp. sugar, divided
- 1 egg, separated
- 1 tsp. vanilla (or as much as desired for taste)

Directions:
- Put 1 c. milk in pot with tapioca, salt and 2 Tbsp. sugar. Beat egg yolk into remaining cup of milk, then add to mixture in pot. Cook over low heat, *stirring constantly* to prevent scorching, until *very* thick and bubbly (takes 20-30 minutes but is worth it!). Boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat.
- Add vanilla. Beat egg white with 2 Tbsp. sugar until stiff and glossy; fold into tapioca. Cool completely, then refrigerate.

Yield: 

Comments: This is best if cold from the refrigerator. Chocolate ice cream goes very well with this when serving. You can easily double or triple this recipe; any amount will not last long!
