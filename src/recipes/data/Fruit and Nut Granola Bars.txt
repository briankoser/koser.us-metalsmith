Name: Fruit and Nut Granola Bars

Tags: breakfast favorite

Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 c. old fashioned oats
- 1/2 c. chopped almonds
- 1/3 c. honey
- 1/4 c. butter
- 1/4 c. packed brown sugar
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 tsp. flax seeds (optional)
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/4 c. dried cranberries
- 1/4 c. raisins
- 1/4 c. chocolate chips, plus extra as needed

Directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine oats and almonds on medium baking sheet and bake 7-10 minutes until lightly toasted (this step is optional, but it gave a nice roasted flavor to the oats and nuts); transfer to a large bowl. Line bottom of a 9" square pan with parchment paper, then lightly grease.
- While oats are toasting, combine butter, honey, brown sugar, vanilla, flax seeds and salt in small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir. Add cranberries and raisins and stir. Let cool about 5 minutes, then stir in chocolate chips. Press evenly into prepared pan, then lightly scatter with more chocolate chips and press to incorporate. Cover pan with plastic wrap and place in fridge for at least 1 hour. Lift up on parchment to remove granola from pan and transfer to countertop. Cut into bars and wrap individually with plastic wrap. May sit at room temperature 1 week, or in fridge several weeks. To freeze, place wrapped bars in Ziploc bag.

Yield: About 12 small bars

Comments: I suggest doubling this recipe, as it otherwise doesn't make very much.
