Tags: dessert fruit favorite fancy

Ingredients:
- 1 c. sugar
- 1 c. water
- 2 Tbsp. lemon juice
- 3 c. fresh raspberries
- 2 Tbsp. orange juice

Directions:
- Heat sugar and water in medium saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Transfer to a medium container and chill in fridge.
- Place raspberries and orange juice in blender and blend until smooth, then press mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove seeds (you may have to do this twice). Pour puree into chilled lemon mixture; stir, then cover and freeze until firm.
- Let sorbet sit at room temp 20-30 minutes, or until no longer frozen solid. Blend in food processor once more, then return to freezer (you'll see the difference as it becomes smoother-looking). To serve, let stand at room temp 5 minutes before scooping.

Yield: 2-3 servings (2 scoops each)

Comments: I suggest making a double batch, as this is so yummy that it will quickly disappear (especially if you love raspberries as much as I do!).
