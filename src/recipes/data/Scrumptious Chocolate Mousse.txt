Name: Scrumptious Chocolate Mousse

Tags: easy dessert fancy favorite

Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 1 (12 oz.) bag of chocolate chips
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 c. *very* hot coffee (or hot chocolate)

Directions:
- Blend first three ingredients, then slowly add coffee while blending (temperature of liquid will help cook the eggs). Blend for two minutes on Low, then one minute on High. Refrigerate until mixture is no longer liquid, then serve. Keep refrigerated to store.

Yield: 3/4 full blender

Comments: This is a very rich but light mousse. I didn't like chocolate mousse before having this one! A variation would be to crumble some chocolate-covered mint Oreos and stir them in.
