Name: Candied Pecans

Ingredients:
- 1 egg white
- 1/2 c. sugar
- 1 tsp. nutmeg
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 2 1/2 c. pecan halves

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
- Brush large cookie sheet with butter. Whisk egg white until foamy, then add all ingredients except pecans; whisk again until mixture is thick and opaque. Mix in nuts and lift out with forks; transfer to cookie sheet, in single layer.
- Bake until deep golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool completely on cookie sheet and store at room temperature, breaking apart pieces that have fused together.

Yield: 50 nuts or so

Comments: These are nice munchables that I make every Christmas; that's usually when you can get a good deal on nuts by buying them in the shell and shelling them yourself. Makes a great gift!
