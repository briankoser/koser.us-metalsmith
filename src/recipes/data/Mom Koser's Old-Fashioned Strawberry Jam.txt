Name: Mom Koser's Old-Fashioned Strawberry Jam

Ingredients:
- Strawberries, 3 dry pints
- 2 1/2 c. sugar
- 2 oz. paraffin wax

Utensils needed:
- 6 oz. preserve jars (4 of them)
- 3 qt. kettle
- sterilizing kettle
- tongs, ladle, wide-mouth funnel
- saucepan and tin cup (or small soup can)

Directions:
- Wash strawberries, removing hulls and leaves. Slice them, cutting out all soft spots. In 3 qt. kettle, alternate layers of sugar and strawberries, beginning and ending with sugar. Cover and set aside until all sugar is absorbed in the juice, 3 hours or more.
- Wash and sterilize all other utensils by boiling them for 15 minutes; let stand in hot water until ready to use.
- Bring berries and sugar to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Stop cooking when the syrup drops from the spoon in sheets. Pour into jars with funnel and seal with paraffin wax.
- To seal: Heat paraffin and pour 1/8" on hot jam. Let cool, then add a second layer. Follow package directions for use. Don't forget to label and date your jars!

Comments: Caution regarding the paraffin: It is flammable, and mice like to eat it. Best put a lid on top of the paraffin.
