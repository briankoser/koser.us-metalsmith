Tags: appetizer fancy crowd party

Ingredients:
- 8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
- 8 oz. finely grated cheddar
- 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- 1 c. ground nuts (I used pecans)
- 1/2 c. sliced almonds
- baby carrots
- Ritz crackers

Directions:
- Mix together cream cheese, grated cheese, Worcestershire sauce, green onions and garlic powder. Cover and chill in refrigerator at least 30 minutes until firm. Remove from fridge and roll into 1" balls. Roll in ground nuts. Gently insert 5-6 sliced almonds in back half of each ball, to look like tail feathers. Chop rounded ends off baby carrots, cutting so that non-rounded end has a V-shape. Insert into front of each ball to look like turkey beak. Serve with Ritz crackers.

Yield: About 15 balls
