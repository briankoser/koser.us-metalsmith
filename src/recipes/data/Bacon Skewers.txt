Ingredients:
- bacon
- maple syrup (optional)

Directions:
- Slide 3 slices of bacon on a skewer, folded loosely accordion-style. Repeat as many times as desired. Lay skewers on top of 9x13" pan, running down length of pan so bacon grease will catch in pan. Place into cold oven and turn heat to 400 degrees. Bake 20-30 minutes or until desired doneness. While still warm, brush on maple syrup.

Yield: yield

Comments: An easy way to cook a lot of bacon, fuss free.
