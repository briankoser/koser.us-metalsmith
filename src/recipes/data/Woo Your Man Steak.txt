Name: Woo Your Man Steak

Ingredients:
- 3 Tbsp. lemon juice (or juice from one lemon)
- 1/2 c. soy sauce
- 3 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- chopped onion
- 2 steaks, 3/4" thick

Directions:
- Mix all ingredients except steak and pour into Ziplock bag. Add steak and marinate 4-12 hours in fridge, turning occasionally.
- To cook, place heatproof cooling rack on a cookie sheet and place steaks on top. Broil on High for 35-45 minutes, turning every 10 minutes. Steaks should be medium-rare when done this way (although it may depend on how open you keep your oven door while broiling).

Yield: 2 steaks

Comments: The title says it all--your taste buds will dance with ecstasy at each bite. The key to even cooking is to use steaks that are not too thick; otherwise, the outside will burn while the inside remains uncooked. This steak tastes good cold in a sandwich, too.
