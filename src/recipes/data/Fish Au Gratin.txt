Name: Fish Au Gratin

Ingredients:
- 1/2 c. fine dry breadcrumbs (I use Italian)
- 1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese
- 8 fillets of tilapia
- mayonnaise

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees, then grease a cookie sheet.
- Combine breadcrumbs and cheese in bowl. Brush both sides of fish with mayo (don't be very stingy) and coat with cheese mixture. Arrange fish in single layer on cookie sheet and bake 5-10 minutes until done (fish will turn white and flake easily with fork).

Yield: Serves 4 people

Comments: Fish is one of my dishes I can't go wrong with--it's so quick and easy to cook, and there are so many ways to vary it. I like tilapia the best for several reasons: it's cheapest, has the best flavor (in my opinion), can be bought in large quantities at Sam's, and can be substituted for almost any other kind of fish.
