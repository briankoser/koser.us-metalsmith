Let cool in pan 15 minutes, then turn onto wire rack to cool completely.

Yield: 1 loaf

Comments: Best banana bread ever! Baking times may vary, and toothpick may  not be completely clean because of cream cheese mixture. If you feel tops and sides will become too brown before center cooks through, you may tent the pan with a sheet of foil after 30 minutes. Watch your bread, not the clock.
