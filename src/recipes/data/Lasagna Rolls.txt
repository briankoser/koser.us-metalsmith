Name: Lasagna Rolls

Ingredients:
- 9 lasagna noodles
- 10 oz. (or to taste) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 8 oz. cooked ground beef
- 15 oz. cottage cheese
- 1/2 c. grated parmesan cheese
- 1 egg
- salt and fresh pepper
- 24 oz. pasta sauce
- roughly 6 oz. shredded mozzarella

Directions:
- Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions and drain; lay on wax paper and pat dry with paper towel. In medium bowl combine spinach, beef, cottage cheese, parmesan, egg, salt and pepper. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Evenly divide mixture between lasagna noodles, then carefully roll up. Pour about 1 cup pasta sauce in 8x12" dish, then place lasagna noodles seam side down in sauce. Pour remaining sauce over noodles and top with cheese. Cover with foil and bake 40 minutes.

Yield: 9 rolls

Comments: Less or more spinach and cottage cheese may be used, depending on taste. Also, amounts may be slightly increased for another 2-3 rolls (I felt a few more would have fit in the pan). Delicious, and easier than ordinary lasagna!
