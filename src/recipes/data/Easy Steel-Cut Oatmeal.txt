Comments: This is seriously one of the best breakfast recipes ever! Easy, tasty, satisfying, easily increased to feed a crowd. If it bothers you to leave the oatmeal sitting out overnight, you can put the jars in the fridge immediately; however, the oatmeal won't be quite as well cooked and will have a thinner, less creamy consistency.
