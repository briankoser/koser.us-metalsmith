Ingredients:
- Cocoa, for dusting (you'll need a fair amount)
- 6 eggs, separated
- 3/4 c. granulated sugar, divided
- 3/4 c. cocoa
- 2 1/2 tsp. vanilla, divided
- pinch of salt
- 1 1/2 c. whipping cream
- 1/2 c. powdered sugar
- garnishes: whipped cream, powdered sugar, strawberries, mint leaves

Directions:
- Grease bottom and sides of a 15x10" jellyroll pan; line with wax paper. Grease wax paper and dust with cocoa; set aside.
- Beat egg whites until soft peaks form; gradually add 1/2 c. granulated sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
- In separate bowl, beat egg yolks at high speed until foamy. Gradually add remaining granulated sugar, beating until thick and pale. Gradually stir in cocoa, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and pinch of salt, beating until blended. Fold egg white mixture into cocoa mixture, then spread batter into prepared jellyroll pan.
- Bake at 375 degrees for 12-15 minutes, or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
- Meanwhile, sift more cocoa onto a cloth towel into a 15x10" rectangle. Remove cake from oven; run a knife around edges of pan to loosen cake, then turn cake onto towel.
- Peel wax paper off cake; trim cake edges and discard. Starting at a short end, gently roll up cake and towel together (roll *loosely*, or your cake will break when you unroll it later). Place cake seam side down on a wire rack to cool, 45-60 minutes.
- Beat whipping cream at low speed until foamy; add 1/2 c. powdered sugar and remaining 1 tsp. vanilla. Beat at high speed until soft peaks form.
- Unroll cake and spread evenly with whipped cream, leaving a 1" border around edges. Gently reroll cake without towel and place seam side down on serving platter. Garnish and serve. Refrigerate leftovers.

Yield: Serves 8 people

Comments: This sounds like a lot of trouble, but it's really not hard at all and is so worth it. Go all out and garnish it--you'll hear oohs and ahhs at the sight and taste of it! On a side note, I don't put all the whipped cream in the cake; I usually spread it about 1/4"-1/2" thick and reserve the rest for garnish.
