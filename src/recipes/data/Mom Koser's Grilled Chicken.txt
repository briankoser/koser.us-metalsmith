Name: Mom Koser's Grilled Chicken

Tags: dinner

Ingredients:
- 3 lbs. chicken (thighs are tastiest and least expensive)
- 1/2 c. water
- 1/2 c. soy sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 tsp. savory
- 1 tsp. Italian seasoning
- fresh ground pepper

Directions:
- Remove skin from chicken and place in large ziplock bag. Add remaining ingredients and close bag, removing as much air as possible. Marinade for at least 1 1/2 hours.
- Grill covered 30-45 minutes until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear; turn chicken only once. Move from direct heat if outside gets done too quickly, and check frequently to douse any flames that start.

Yield: 

Comments: The chicken can also be frozen in the marinade to use at a later date; just thaw before use.
