Comments: This is an excellent post-Thanksgiving meal, and another meat/veggies/starch all-in-one. This will definitely feed a crowd and require a fair amount of effort to prepare, but it is so worth it. The ingredients may not seem to go well together, but believe me, they are fabulous! This is a family favorite that Brian said had not been overpraised. :)
