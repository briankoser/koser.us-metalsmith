Name: Roasted Pesto Tomatoes

Ingredients:
- tomatoes
- olive oil
- oregano, salt and pepper
- basil pesto
- grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Heat oven to 425 degrees. Slice tomatoes 1/4-1/2" thick. Arrange in single layer on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with oregano, salt and pepper and bake 10 minutes. Remove from oven and spread each slice with pesto (not too thick). Sprinkle with parmesan and return to oven for 7-10 minutes, or until cheese starts to brown.

Yield*: may vary

Comments: 4 large tomatoes almost covered a large cookie sheet. Be careful not to oversalt, as pesto is likely salty.
