Name: Crockpot Beef Soup

Ingredients:
- 4 lbs. beef stew meat
- 2/3 c. flour
- 3-6 Tbsp. olive oil, divided
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 4 celery ribs, thinly sliced
- 6 garlic cloves, pressed
- 56 oz. beef broth (4 14-oz. cans)
- 6 oz. chopped mushrooms
- 4 tsp. dried thyme
- scant 2 tsp. salt
- 2 tsp. freshly ground pepper

Directions:
- Combine beef and flour in large Ziploc bag; shake well to coat. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef until browned on all sides, then place in crockpot. Use drippings to cook onion, celery and garlic; add to crockpot. Add remaining ingredients. Cover and cook on Low 6-8 hours or until beef is tender.

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: You probably don't want the soup to cook all 8 hours, as it's rather easy to overcook the meat.
