Name: Mom Koser's Play Clay

Ingredients:
- 6 c. baking soda
- 3 c. corn starch
- 3 1/2 c. water
- 1/2 c. salt

Directions:
- Stir together ingredients in saucepan until mixed well. Cook on medium heat, stirring continually until mixture thickens and bubbles (may get difficult to stir). Spoon onto board; cover with a damp cloth and let cool (in very humid climates you may not need the damp cloth, but you don't want the clay to dry out).
- Knead clay smooth when cool enough to handle. Divide into batches. Add food coloring if desired (if wanting to use same color with entire batch, coloring may be added with the water). Store in tightly sealed plastic bag or a jar in fridge.

Yield: 

Comments: Play clay will harden slowly without baking unless you are in a humid climate. To hasten hardening you can bake at a low temperature (250 degrees). You can also paint or decorate clay once hardened.
