Roll Ingredients:
- 1 pkg. yeast
- 1 c. warm water
- 1/4 c. white sugar
- 1 tsp. salt
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 1 egg

Topping Ingredients:
- 1/2 c. butter
- 1/2 c. brown sugar
- 1/2 c. white sugar

- 3 Tbsp. milk
- 1/2 c. chopped nuts

Directions:
- Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 1/4 c. sugar, salt and butter and mix well. Beat egg and add to mixture. Add flour and knead until well mixed. Put in greased bowl; grease top of dough and cover. Refrigerate overnight.
- On lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/2" thickness. Spread with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon (be generous!).
- Roll up and cut into 2" slices; set aside.
- For topping: melt butter in saucepan, then add remaining ingredients and heat, stirring frequently. Pour into *large* baking pan, set rolls into syrup and cover. Let rise 1 hour.
- Bake at 375 degrees fro 20 minutes. Invert rolls onto serving dish and serve.

Yield: Makes 10-12 rolls

Comments: I recommend using a large pan for this, as the rolls will swell to immense sizes. If you don't want huge rolls, only let them rise for half an hour. I've also forgone cutting the roll into slices, and just made cinnamon logs.
