Tags: dinner

Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 lbs. chicken pieces (or 6 chicken breasts)
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (8 oz.) jellied cranberry sauce
- 1/4 c. corn syrup
- 2 Tbsp. lemon juice
- 2 Tbsp. melted butter
- 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary

Directions:
- Brown chicken over medium-high heat, then transfer to baking dish. Heat and stir remaining ingredients and pour over chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, or until cooked.

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: Not a fancy dish, but tender and tasty. A great way to use up leftover cranberry sauce.
Variation: Heat grill to medium. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Mix remaining ingredients. Grill chicken bone side up uncovered for 20 minutes. Turn chicken and grill another 20-30 minutes or until tender and juices run clear, brushing often with sauce during last 15 minutes of cooking.
