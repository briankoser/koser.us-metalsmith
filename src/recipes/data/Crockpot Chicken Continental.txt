Tags: dinner

Ingredients:
- 9-12 oz. dried beef
- 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 c. sour cream
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup
- 1/4 c. flour

Directions:
- Lightly grease slow cooker and line with 1/3 of the dried beef. Place 3 chicken breasts in cooker.
- Mix together sour cream, soup and flour; pour half over chicken. Layer beef, chicken, mixture and remaining beef. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours. Serve over rice.

Yield: Serves 6

Comments: This is a very filling meal. Go easy on the beef, as it is very salty. A nice perk for this recipe is that the chicken doesn't need to be defrosted. I recommend serving fruit juice with this meal--milk or soda will fill guests up too much.
