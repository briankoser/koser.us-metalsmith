Name: Carrot Souffle

Tags: side dessert Thanksgiving

Ingredients:
- 1 3/4 lbs. carrots, peeled and chopped
- *1 c. white sugar (use less if desired)
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- dash or two of nutmeg
- 2 Tbsp. flour
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 1/2 c. butter, softened

Directions:
- Cook carrots in boiling water until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to large mixing bowl. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- While carrots are warm, use an electric mixer to beat smooth; add sugar, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste to be sure desired flavor has been reached, then mix in flour, eggs and butter. Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish.
- Bake 1 hour or until top is golden brown.

Yield: Serves 6

Comments: This may sound like a side dish, but it can also work as a dessert (tastes like pumpkin pie, except better). I like to sprinkle the top with brown sugar and chopped pecans, and serve with a dollop of whipped cream. *If making as a side dish, omit the white sugar and only use 1/4 c. brown sugar (not pressed).
