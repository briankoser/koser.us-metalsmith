Name: Stuffed Bell Peppers

Ingredients:
- 4 *large* red bell peppers, with flat bottoms, or 6 small
- 1 lb. ground beef
- chopped onion to taste
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 small can green chilies, with juice
- paprika and salt to taste
- 2 Tbsp. flour
- 1 c. beef stock
- 1/2 c. cream
- 3/4 block cream cheese
- sprinkling of cayenne pepper and salt
- 1/2 c. raisins (more or less)

Directions:
- Cut the tops off the bell peppers; remove seeds and membranes without piercing shells or bottoms, then set aside. Remove stems from tops and chop excess pepper.
- In a skillet, cook beef, onion, garlic and excess bell pepper. Add chilies, paprika and salt, then stir in flour. Gradually stir in stock. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat, cover and let simmer 30 minutes (you may reduce this time if desired).
- Heat oven to 350 degrees. Brush an ovenproof dish with oil. Spoon beef mixture into bell peppers; stand them upright in prepared dish and bake for 45 minutes.
- When you have 5-10 minutes left, heat all remaining ingredients (except raisins) in saucepan; stir constantly until smooth. Add raisins and heat; do not let mixture boil.
- Remove peppers from oven and pour cream sauce over them; return to oven and bake an additional 15 minutes. Serve immediately. 

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: This is my prize-winning recipe, practically guaranteed to turn the staunch disliker of bell peppers into a believer. The meat mixture can be made in advance so that all you have to do is cook the peppers the next day (I actually prefer to do so, as the liquid congeals in the fridge and isn't so messy while spooning into the peppers). Suggested sides: Corn, biscuits and fruit juice (although the peppers are quite filling).
