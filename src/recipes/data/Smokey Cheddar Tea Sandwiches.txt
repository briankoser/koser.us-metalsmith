Name: Smokey Cheddar Tea Sandwiches

Tags: party crowd appetizer

Ingredients:
- 16 oz. cream cheese, softened
- 2 1/2 c. mayonnaise
- 3 tsp. smokey paprika
- 1 1/4 tsp. salt
- 24 oz. cheddar cheese, finely shredded
- 7 oz. sun-dried tomatoes, drained and finely chopped
- 36 bread slices (sourdough or dark wheat)
- softened butter

Directions:
- Cream together cream cheese, mayo, paprika and salt. Stir in cheddar and sun-dried tomatoes (mixture may be made the night before). On cold bread*, spread a thin layer of butter on each slice (keeps bread from getting soggy). Top with cheese mixture and another buttered slice of bread, then slice off crusts. Cut diagonally for triangles (36 sandwhiches) or perpendicularly for squares (72 sandwiches). To store, place sandwiches on serving dish. Cover with waxed paper, then a single layer of damp paper towels, then plastic wrap.

Yield: 18 full-size sandwiches

Comments: *Cold bread cuts more cleanly, so if possible try to slice the crusts and sandwiches while the bread is cold.
