Name: Chocolate Dessert Cups

Tags: fancy

Ingredients:
- 6 oz. semisweet chocolate
- 1 tsp. shortening

Directions:
- In microwave, melt chocolate and shortening; stir until smooth. On waxed paper, pour chocolate onto 4 or 6 separate places and spread into 6" circles. Spread the chocolate thinly, or you will have some very thick chocolate bowls (too much chocolate, believe it or not).
- Cut chocolate circles out of waxed paper and refrigerate3-4 minutes, or until chocolate does not spread when handled. Invert 6 cups or small bowls in fridge; drape circles over bowls, waxed paper side down (shape edges if desired). Chill 10 minutes, then carefully peel waxed paper from chocolate cups. Cups may be made a week in advance; store in refrigerator in airtight container.

Yield: 6 cups

Comments: This is a fancy way to serve ice cream, fruit, pudding, etc.
