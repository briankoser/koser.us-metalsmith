Name: Bell Pepper and Shrimp Soup

Ingredients:
- 4 red bell peppers (or canned equivalent)
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 cans chicken broth
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to taste
- 1-1 1/2 lbs. uncooked medium shrimp
- 1/2 c. heavy cream

Directions:
- Cut peppers in half and seed; place on baking sheet and broil until blackened in areas. Move to a paper bag and close tightly, allowing to cool for 20 minutes. Peel skin off peppers and chop.
- Saute onion, garlic and peppers in oil until translucent. Add broth, tomatoes and seasonings and cook on medium heat 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Comments: Not bad. The shrimp is a must.
