Name: Carrot Apple Bread

Ingredients:
- 1 egg
- 1/2 c. packed brown sugar
- 1/3 c. liquid-state coconut oil (or vegetable or canola)
- 1/4 c. white sugar
- 1/4 c. sour cream
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
- 1 c. flour
- 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda

Directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 9x5" loaf pan; set aside. In large bowl beat together first eight ingredients (through nutmeg). Add flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and stir until just combined. Fold in carrots and apples, then turn batter into prepared pan. Bake 45-52 minutes or until top is golden, center is set and inserted toothpick comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs.

Yield: 1 loaf

Comments: This isn't a WOW! bread or a very sweet bread, but it makes a nice breakfast all the same. The flavors blend together the longer it sits, so that it tastes better a day or two after making it. It's a good solid bread for when you're tired of eating super sugary-tasting food for breakfast.
