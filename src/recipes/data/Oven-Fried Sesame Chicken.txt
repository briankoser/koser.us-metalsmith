- 2 (or more) Tbsp. butter, melted

Directions:
- Heat oven to 400 degrees.

Comments: I made this with boneless chicken--take off 5-10 minutes of cook time and they're fine. Be sure to drizzle the butter over all the top of the chicken (melt more if necessary); it really makes the chicken turn out juicy.
