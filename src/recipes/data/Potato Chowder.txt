Ingredients:
- 4 c. peeled, diced potatoes
- 1/2 c. chopped onion
- 1 c. chopped carrots
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. pepper
- 1 Tbsp. parsley
- 4 chicken bouillon cubes
- water to cover
- 4 c. milk
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 1/2 c. flour
- grated cheddar to taste (optional)

Directions:
- In large pot combine all but last three ingredients. Cook about 15 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
- Heat milk in saucepan and whisk in butter and flour. Add to pot and simmer for 15 minutes. Add cheddar during last 5 minutes of cooking.

Yield: 4-6 servings

Comments: This is a tasty way to use up a lot of milk that might go bad soon. Peas go great in this soup as well--simply add during last 15 minutes of cooking.
