Name: Fabulous Barbecued Shrimp

Ingredients:
- 4 Tbsp. smoky barbecue rub
- 4 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 Tbsp. Louisiana hot sauce
- 4 garlic cloves, pressed
- 32 jumbo uncooked shrimp, shells on

Directions:
- Prepare grill for direct cooking over medium-high heat. Combine all ingredients and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate until ready to grill. Grill shrimp 3 minutes or until shells are blackened on one side; turn and grill 3-5 minutes more (shells should be blackened and shrimp opaque).

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: This is great with crab-stuffed potatoes, Italian bagels and some fruit (pomegranate worked well for us).
