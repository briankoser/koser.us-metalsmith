Tags: dinner

Ingredients:
- 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled
- 3 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 4 carrots, chopped
- 4 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 c. lentils
- 1 Tbsp. cumin
- 2 qt. vegetable broth
- 1 bay leaf
- 1-2 tsp. dried thyme
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
- In large pot over medium heat, cook unpeeled garlic cloves and let toast until browned and fragrant. Remove from pan. Add olive oil, onion, carrots and celery and cook until tender. Peel and smash garlic and add to pot, along with lentils and cumin. Cook a few seconds until lentils are nicely coated in oil. Add broth, bay leaf and thyme and simmer 30 minutes, or until lentils are tender. Season with salt and pepper, remove bay leaf and serve.

Yield: Serves 6-8

Comments: Soup is fine on its own, but shines when served with hunks of cheesy bread. Diced ham may also be added to the soup.
