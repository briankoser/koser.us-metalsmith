Comments: I served this as a breakfast. To serve as a dessert, increase the sugar to 3/4 c. and serve with whipped cream. It is a very flexible recipe--pretty much any kind of bread can be used, and brown sugar could be subbed for the white sugar. More or less bread can be used to achieve the desired consistency.
