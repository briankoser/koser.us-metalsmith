Name: Crockpot Applesauce

Tags: easy crowd favorite snack

Ingredients:
- 9 apples peeled, cored and chopped
- 1-2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/4 c. brown sugar

Directions:
- Place all ingredients in crockpot; cover and cook on High for 4 hours, stirring every hour to get liquids moving. When finished, remove cinnamon sticks and mash applesauce to desired consistency (I like it somewhat chunky). Serve warm or cold.

Yield: 6-8 cups

Comments: Much better than store-bought, and healthier too!
