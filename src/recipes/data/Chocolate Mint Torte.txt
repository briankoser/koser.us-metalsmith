Name: Chocolate Mint Torte

Tags: dessert fancy favorite

Ingredients:
- 8 oz. semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 stick butter, cut into small pads
- 1/4 c. heavy cream
- 3 large eggs
- 2 Tbsp. sugar
- 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract
- 1 tsp. cocoa powder
- fresh mint leaves and chocolate curls (garnish)
- whipped cream

Directions:
- Set roasting pan on lowest rack of oven; fill pan halfway with water. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- Coat a 9x4" loaf pan with cooking spray. Cut parchment paper large enough to cover bottom and to hang over long sides of loaf pan; place in pan and coat with cooking spray.
- Put chocolate and butter in heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir over *low* heat until melted. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
- Beat heavy cream (with *whisk* attachment of a mixer) on medium-high until *soft* peaks form (1-2 min.); do not overbeat. Set aside.
- Beat eggs and sugar in separate bowl with whisk on medium-high until tripled in volume (3-4 minutes). Gently fold half the chocolate mixture into egg mixture, then add the other half (splitting the volume helps keep the torte fluffy). Fold in whipped cream and peppermint extract.
- Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan and set in roasting pan. Bake about 25 min. (chocolate will have lost its sheen and will appear set when loaf pan is jiggled).
- Remove loaf pan and let cool completely on wire rack. Pulling up on parchment paper, remove torte from pan and transfer to cookie sheet; refrigerate 30 minutes.
- Using an offset spatula, gently loosen torte from parchment and invert onto serving platter. Lightly dust torte with cocoa. Garnish and serve with whipped cream.

Yield: 6-8 servings, thinly sliced

Comments: The torte can be made up to 2 days in advance. This dessert is heavenly goodness itself, and will float in your mouth. The key to this dish lies in melting the chocolate and butter--be absolutely *sure* all the lumps are gone and the chocolate is completely liquid. Try to keep as much air as possible in this dish. I recommend adding the garnish--if you're going to make a fancy dish, go the extra mile!
