Name: Bacon-Spinach Salad

Tags: large side

Ingredients:
- 4 slices bacon
- 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 5 medium green onions, chopped
- 2 tsp. sugar
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. pepper
- 2 Tbsp. white or cider vinegar
- 8 oz. washed fresh spinach leaves
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced

Directions:
- Cook bacon until crisp; remove and drain on paper towels, then crumble into bite-size pieces. Drain all but 3 Tbsp. grease from skillet (if there aren't 3 Tbsp. remaining, add enough vegetable oil to equal 3 Tbsp.). Add oil, onions, sugar, salt and pepper and cook 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally until onions are slightly softened. Stir in vinegar. Place spinach in large bowl. Pour warm dressing over spinach and toss to coat. Arrange egg slices on top and sprinkle with bacon. Serve immediately.

Yield: Serves 6

Comments: The eggs and bacon make this pretty to look at; better than that, the bacon grease really adds some pop to the salad dressing!
