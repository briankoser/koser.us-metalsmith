Name: Sesame Buttered Broccoli

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 lb. broccoli (I used frozen, already cut)
- 2 Tbsp. butter, melted
- 2 tsp. soy sauce
- 1 tsp. sesame seeds, toasted (the toasted part is optional, but it does give a nice crunch)
- 1/2 tsp. sesame oil (or olive oil)

Directions:
- In 2-qt. saucepan, heat 1" water to boiling. Add broccoli and return to boil; let boil 4-6 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain well and place broccoli in serving bowl. In small, separate bowl stir remaining ingredients until well mixed; pour over broccoli and toss to coat.

Yield: Serves 4
