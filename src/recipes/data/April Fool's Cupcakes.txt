- 1 lb. *lean* ground beef
- 1/2 c. seasoned breadcrumbs
- 1 c. cheese (Monterey Jack or Cheddar)
- 3 Tbsp. ketchup

- 1/4 tsp. pepper
- 3 c. mashed potatoes, in three colors

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Yield: 12 "cupcakes"

Comments: I always get rave reviews on this, for appearance and for taste! Be sure to use lean beef--otherwise, you'll have to drain a lot of grease out of the cupcakes before adding the potatoes. I usually use ordinary salt instead of celery salt.
