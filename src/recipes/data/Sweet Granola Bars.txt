Name: Sweet Granola Bars

Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 c. rice krispies
- 2 c. old-fashioned oats
- 1/4 c. flax seeds
- 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/2 c. honey
- 1/3 c. brown sugar
- 1/2 c. peanut butter
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/2-1 c. chocolate chips* (just eyeball it)

Directions:
- Line a 9x13" baking dish with waxed paper. In large bowl stir together rice krispies, oats, flax seeds and cinnamon. In medium saucepan combine honey and brown sugar; heat to boiling, stirring constantly, then remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter and vanilla. Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir to combine. Let cool a few minutes, then stir in chocolate chips. Press mixture evenly into prepared dish and set aside to cool completely, at least an hour. Lift up on wax paper to remove granola from pan, then slice into bars and wrap individually with plastic wrap. May sit at room temperature 1 week, or in fridge several weeks. To freeze, place wrapped bars in Ziploc bag.

Yield: About 16 bars

Comments: *If desired, chocolate chips can be mixed in with dry ingredients. When hot honey mixture is poured over dry ingredients, chocolate will melt and be incorporated throughout mixture instead of remaining as chunks.
