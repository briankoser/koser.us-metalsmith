Name: Fool-Proof Pizza Dough

Ingredients:
- 3/4 c. and 2 Tbsp. water, heated to 115 degrees
- 2 tsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. yeast
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 2 Tbsp. oil or butter
- 2 1/2 c. flour

Directions:
- Mix first three ingredients and let stand 5-10 minutes until foamy. Add remaining ingredients and knead on counter until smooth and elastic. Let rest 5 minutes.
- Roll out onto cookie sheet or pizza pan. Top as desired. Bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes; crust should be golden.

Yield: 1 crust

Comments: A double recipe yields 3 crusts, one thick and two thin. If you want the crust to be more bread-like use it right away; if you want it to be like Pizza Hut's, freeze it overnight or at least 4 hours. Note: If using Stoneware to freeze crust, let stone warm up before putting on hot oven rack; or, put in cold oven and leave there while oven heats up.
