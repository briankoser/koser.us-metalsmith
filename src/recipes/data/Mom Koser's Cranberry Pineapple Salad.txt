Name: Mom Koser's Cranberry Pineapple Salad

Ingredients:
- 1 (6 oz.) pkg. raspberry jello
- 1 3/4 c. boiling water
- 1 (16 oz.) can cranberry sauce
- 1 (8 oz). can crushed pineapple, undrained
- 3/4 c. orange juice
- 1 Tbsp. lemon juice
- 1/2 c. chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)

Directions:
- In a bowl, dissolve jello in boiling water. Break in cranberry sauce. Add remaining ingredients except nuts and chill until partially set.
- Stir in nuts and pour into pan. Chill until firm.

Yield: 4 servings

Comments: This is great at Thanksgiving for something other than plain cranberry sauce! Do NOT use fresh pineapple; it will keep the jello from setting.
