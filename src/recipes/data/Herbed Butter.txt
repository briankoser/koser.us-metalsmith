Name: Herbed Butter

Tags: side fancy crowd party

Ingredients:
- 2 sticks of butter, softened
- 3/4 Tbsp. parsley
- 3/4 Tbsp. dill

Directions:
- Mix all ingredients together. I would suggest adding the herbs to the butter gradually and tasting to see if you think the flavor is too strong. Store in refrigerator up to 2 days. To keep longer, freeze. Bring to room temperature before using.

Yield: Serves 10?

Comments: This will make a lot of butter, so you may wish to halve the recipe if feeding fewer than 10.
