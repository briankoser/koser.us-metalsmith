Name: Mom Koser's Ham Loaf

Loaf Ingredients:
- 1 lb. fresh pork, ground
- 1 lb. cured ham, ground
- 1 c. bread crumbs
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/8 tsp. pepper
- 3/4 to 1 c. milk (enough so that mixture is not dry)

Sauce Ingredients:
- 3/4 c. brown sugar
- 1/2 c. water
- 1 tsp. dry mustard
- 1/2 c. apple cider vinegar

Directions:
- Mix all loaf ingredients in large bowl. Place into roasting pan large enough to hold it (if you double the recipe a 9x13" pan will be fine; just make a taller loaf). Dust with flour and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.
- Mix together sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil and pour over ham loaf. Return to oven for another half hour to an hour; it will thicken and be a sweet 'n' sour sauce.

Yield: 4-5 servings

Comments: You can prepare the ham loaf, wrap it well and freeze it until you wish to bake it. Place in the oven frozen and cover with foil until you add the sauce.
