Name: Bacon 'n' Egg Bundles

Tags: fancy breakfast favorite

Ingredients:
- Butter, for greasing
- 24 bacon strips, cooked but not crisp
- 12 eggs

Directions:
- Lightly grease a muffin tin with butter. Tear bacon strips in half width-wise. Line the bottoms of each muffin cup with two bacon pieces, and line the sides with two more pieces; the bacon should now look like a little "cup." Crack one egg into each cup.
- Bake uncovered at 325 degrees for 12-18 minutes, or until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not firm.

Yield: 12 "muffins"

Comments: These will be an instant hit. The bacon flavor seeps into the eggs while they bake, making them very savory.
