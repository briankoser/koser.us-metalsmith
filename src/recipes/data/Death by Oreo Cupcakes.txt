Name: Death by Oreo Cupcakes

Ingredients:
- 24 cupcake liners
- 46 Oreo cookies
- 1 chocolate cake mix
- ingredients for cake mix
- 8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
- 1/2 c. butter, room temperature
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 c. powdered sugar

Directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees and line muffin tins with cupcake liners. Place an Oreo in the bottom of each liner. Mix cake mix according to box directions, but do not bake. Break 12 Oreos into pieces and stir into cake mix. Fill cupcake liners and bake 15 minutes (or according to box directions--inserted toothpick should come out clean).
- In separate bowl beat cream cheese, butter and vanilla extract together. Beat in powdered sugar. Chop 10 Oreos into very fine crumbs (I used a food processor). Add to frosting and beat in. Place frosting into Ziploc bag, seal, and snip the corner. Frost cupcakes.

Yield: 24 cupcakes
