Name: Orange Marmalade Chops

Ingredients:
- salt and pepper
- 4-6 bone-in pork chops
- 1 c. orange marmalade
- 3 Tbsp. Dijon-style mustard
- 3 Tbsp. soy sauce

Directions:
- Place a cooling rack on a cookie sheet and turn oven to broil. Place chops on cooling rack and sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Broil on both sides until mostly cooked, 4-5 minutes each side. Meanwhile, heat remaining ingredients in small saucepan until hot and liquid. Brush some on chops for last two minutes of cooking, then heat remaining sauce until boiling and serve with chops.

Yield: 4-6 chops

Comments: I wouldn't use the excess liquid on rice--it tastes great with the chops because of the salt/pepper, but by itself it's not that great. Very easy and quick recipe!
