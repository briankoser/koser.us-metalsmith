Name: Strawberry Cream Crescent Rolls

Ingredients:
- 1 can crescent rolls
- 1 c. roughly chopped strawberries
- 4 oz. cream cheese, softened
- 3 Tbsp. sugar
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

Directions:
- Heat oven to 375 degrees. Unroll dough. In small bowl combine cream cheese, strawberries, sugar and vanilla. Scoop mixture onto larger ends of each dough triangle. Carefully roll up, starting with larger side and moving towards the point. Bake 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool and dust with powdered sugar.

Comments: Very easy and tasty! Strawberry preserves may be substituted for fresh strawberries. Simply mix together cream cheese, sugar and vanilla, then scoop onto dough. Add a dollop of preserves before rolling up!
