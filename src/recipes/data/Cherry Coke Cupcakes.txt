Name: Cherry Coke Cupcakes

Cake Ingredients:
- 3 c. flour
- 6 Tbsp. cocoa powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 1/2 c. sugar
- 1 c. butter, room temperature
- 2 eggs
- 1 c. buttermilk
- 1 1/2 c. Coke (don't use diet)
- 3 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 can cherry pie filling

Glaze Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 c. powdered sugar
- 3-4 Tbsp. Coke

Icing Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 c. heavy cream
- 6 Tbsp. powdered sugar
- 18 bing cherries (garnish)

Directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees and line muffin pan with cupcake liners (do not omit liners!). Mix together flour, baking soda, salt and cocoa in a bowl and set aside. In separate mixing bowl, combine sugar and butter and beat on medium-high until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs one at a time, beating well after each and scraping down sides of bowl. In small separate bowl, combine buttermilk, Coke and vanilla extract; be sure to let foam calm down.
- Beginning with flour mixture, add to the butter mixture, alternating with Coke mixture in 4 parts. Beat each addition just until incorporated. Fill each muffin tin 3/4 full. Bake 18-20 minutes, or until inserted toothpick comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes in pan, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.
- Once cooled, use melon baller to scoop out a hole in the center of each cupcake. Add a spoonful of cherry pie filling to each. Whisk together glaze ingredients and spoon glaze over tops of cupcakes. In separate bowl, beat heavy cream and until fluffy, then beat in powdered sugar. Pipe onto tops of cupcakes and garnish with cherries.
