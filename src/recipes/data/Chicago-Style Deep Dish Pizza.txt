Crust Ingredients:
- 3 1/4 c. flour
- 1/2 c. yellow cornmeal
- 1 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1 Tbsp. sugar
- 2 1/4 tsp. active dry yeast
- 1 1/4 c. slighly warm water (around 90 degrees)
- 1/2 c. butter, divided (1/4 c. melted and cooled, 1/4 c. softened)
- olive oil for coating

Sauce Ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 1 small onion, grated (about 1/3 cup)
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. oregano
- 1/2 tsp. red pepper (optional)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes
- 1/4 tsp. sugar

Topping Ingredients:
- 4 c. shredded mozzarella cheese
- desired toppings: cooked/crumbled bacon, cooked ground beef, pepperoni slices, bell pepper slices, onions, etc.
- 1/2 c. parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Grease two 9" round cake pans and preheat oven to 250 degrees. For crust: combine flour, cornmeal and salt in large bowl. Place sugar and yeast in warm water, stir and let sit 5 minutes. Add yeast mixture and butter to flour mixture and stir until dough is soft, supple and gently pulls away from sides of bowl. (If dough feels too tough, beat in 1 tsp. warm water; if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tbsp. flour.) Remove dough from bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease a very large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning dough so all sides are coated with oil. Cover bowl tightly with aluminum foil. Turn oven off and place bowl in warm oven, closing the door. Let dough rise 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.
- Once dough is done rising in oven, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dough from bowl and set on floured surface, setting bowl and aluminum foil aside for use later. Gently punch down dough to remove any air bubbles, and roll dough into large 15x12" rectangle. Spread 1/4 c. softened butter on top of dough. Starting on left side of rectangle, roll up dough lengthwise. Cut dough log in half and form into two separate balls. Place back into bowl, cover with foil and allow to rise in refrigerator 1 hour.
- Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Place butter in medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt. Add grated onion, salt, oregano and red pepper. Let onion brown slightly (about 5 minutes), then add garlic, tomatoes and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and allow to simmer until sauce is hearty, fragrant and thick, about 30 minutes. You should have about 2 1/2 c. sauce; if you have more than that, keep simmering until amount has reduced.
- Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Roll out one ball of dough on lightly floured surface, keeping other ball of dough in refrigerator. Work into 12" circle, then use rolling pin to help place dough over 9" round cake pan. Press dough tightly into pan, trimming off excess dough from edges with a knife. Repeat with 2nd ball of dough on a 2nd cake pan. Brush top edges with a little olive oil, then fill each pizza with 1/2 the cheese. Add toppings, then cover each pizza with 1/2 the sauce. Sprinkle lightly with parmesan cheese and bake 20-28 minutes, or until crust is golden brown (may be covered loosely with foil after 15 minutes to prevent heavy browning or uneven baking). Remove pans to wire rack and let cool 10 minutes. Use spatula to help lift onto cutting board; slice and serve.

Yield: Feeds 4, two slices each

Comments: Store in fridge up to 5 days; reheat leftovers in 300 degree oven for 15 minutes. Dough may be made 1 day in advance, up to letting rise in refrigerator; simply punch down to remove air bubbles before rolling into 12" circles. Sauce may be made up to 2 days in advance. This pizza is a lot of work, but it is so worth it!
