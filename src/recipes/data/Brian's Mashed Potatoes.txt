Name: Brian's Mashed Potatoes

Tags: side favorite Thanksgiving fancy crowd

Ingredients:
- Baking potatoes (use number of people serving + 1 potatoes)
- Butter (1/2 stick of butter per 5 potatoes)
- Milk (not much)

Directions:
- Fill a large pot with water. Salt the water to taste and bring it to a boil. Make sure to use plenty of water.
- Peel and cut the potatoes, the thinner the better. When the water comes to a boil, put potatoes in the pot, stirring occasionally.
- Put butter and milk into a bowl and heat until hot.
- Remove potatoes when they are soft all through, but before they get "shaggy" (usually 15-25 minutes).
- Drain the potatoes in a colander, then put back into the pot. Turn the burner to low and steam the potatoes dry.
- Remove potatoes from heat. Add milk/butter mixture and salt. Mash the potatoes until they reach "fluffy mountain" stage (about 2 minutes). A brief, efficient mashing keeps the potatoes from turning gummy.
- Taste. Add more salt, butter, and milk until you are satisfied with taste and texture. Make sure not to undersalt; you will use more than you expect. Be generous with salt and butter, stingy with milk.

Comments: Hot, dry potatoes and hot butter are the keys to good mashed potatoes. You can also add pepper, parsley flakes, or sour cream for variety.
