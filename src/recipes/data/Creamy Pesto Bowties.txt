Name: Creamy Pesto Bowties

Tags: dinner

Ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 4 chicken breast halves, cut into cubes
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- 1/2 c. pesto sauce
- 1/2 c. milk
- 12 oz. bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 3 c. bow tie pasta, cooked and drained

Directions:
- Heat butter in large, deep skillet; add chicken and fry until cooked, stirring often. Add to skillet soup, pesto and milk and stir, heating to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook 5 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Stir in bacon and pasta and heat through.

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: I used 1-2 c. cooked shredded chicken instead of raw chicken. The bacon is a must, for both flavor and texture enhancement.
