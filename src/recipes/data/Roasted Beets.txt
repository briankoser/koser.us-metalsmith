Name: Roasted Beets

Tags: easy favorite side

Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 lbs. beets
- 2 Tbsp. coconut oil, melted
- salt to taste

Directions:
- Heat oven to 400 degrees. Peel and dice beets. Spread onto baking sheet, drizzle with coconut oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast 35-45 minutes until beets are soft, slightly caramelized and starting to get crispy. The longer time will result in crispier edges.

Yield: Serves 4

Comments: I usually hate beets, but done this way they're not bad. Best when fresh out of the oven.
