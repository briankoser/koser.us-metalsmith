Tags: breakfast crowd easy

Ingredients:
- 3 c. old fashioned oats
- 1 1/2 c. brown sugar
- 5 1/2 c. milk
- 1/2 c. peanut butter
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 1 c. raisins (optional)
- 1 c. chocolate chips

Directions:
- Grease a 9x13" pan. In large pot mix milk, brown sugar, peanut butter and eggs. Simmer over medium heat 20 minutes or until thickened, stirring regularly. Once mixture is thick, stir in raisins. Pour into pan and top with chocolate chips. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until oatmeal is set. Let stand 5 minutes, then serve warm.

Yield: Serves 12

Comments: Not too sweet, in spite of its ingredients. Pleasantly filling. If desired, omit raisins; stir in a handful of chocolate chips right before pouring into pan, then continue with recipe as normal.
