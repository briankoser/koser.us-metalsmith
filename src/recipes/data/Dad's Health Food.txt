Name: Dad's Health Food

Ingredients:
- 4 Tbsp. soy lecithin granules
- 8 Tbsp. sesame seeds
- 8 Tbsp. raw sunflower seeds (unsalted, uncooked)
- 1 c. flax seeds
- 2 Tbsp. honey

Directions:
- Grind all seeds until pulverized. Mix together and add honey. Eat for breakfast first thing each day, then keep refrigerated. May be eaten with your favorite fruits as well.

Yield: 1 mix lasts a little over a week

Comments: Liquid soy lecithin may be used, but granules are much better. Refrigeration is not required (if you're traveling), but it is better. This mix is the reason my dad had been able to walk all my life! It has greatly improved his blood circulation, but it must be eaten weekly.
