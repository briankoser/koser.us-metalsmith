An excellent book on design. Norman introduces concepts such as affordances, mappings, and constraints, and then gives practical examples with objects such as doors, telephones, and light switches. An example of his observations: 

People always assign a cause to an effect. Make the cause obvious, or your user will create an incorrect mental model. 

And one of my favorite quotes:

> Each technological advance that provides a mental aid also brings along critics who decry the loss of the human skill that has been made less valuable. Fine, I say: if the skill is easily automated, it wasn’t essential.

Recommended for anyone who does any sort of design, including computer or web design.
