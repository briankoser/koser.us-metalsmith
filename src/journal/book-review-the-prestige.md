If you haven’t seen the movie: it’s the story of two rival magicians in late 1800’s London, each with their own lives and secrets. Masterfully written; check it out.

If you have seen the movie: Christopher Nolan did a top-notch job of adapting the story for screen, but the book is definitely still worth reading.

    <summary>Expand for spoilers</summary>
    
    <p>The book is rife with parallels and ironies:</p>
    <ul class="book-spoilers">
        <li>Angier and Borden both use doubles for their transporting illusion.
        <li>Both indirectly kill each other.
        <li>Borden is two men known by one name while Angier is one man known by two names (Rupert and Robert).
        <li>Both men lead double lives (Angier as a magician and a lord).
    </ul>

    <p>Possibly my favorite:</p>

    <ul class="book-spoilers">
        <li>In the beginning Angier swindles families by holding seances and pretending to communicate with their dead loved ones; at the end, he becomes a ghost himself.
    </ul>
