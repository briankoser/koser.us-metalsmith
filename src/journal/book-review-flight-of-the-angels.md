{{bookdisplay|safe}} is Christian sci-fi, an uncrowded genre. The premise is that, with Christianity now illegal, a colony of Christians is trying to just stay alive while avoiding detection. Unknown to them, someone is starting to target Christians for death.

The writing is solid, and the authors avoid being preachy, the biggest trap of Christian fiction. The world is fleshed out while leaving plenty to explore in future books.
