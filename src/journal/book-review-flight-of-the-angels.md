{{bookdisplay|safe}} is Christian sci-fi, an uncrowded genre. The premise is that, with Christianity now illegal, a colony of Christians must remain hidden to stay alive. Some work to secretly help them, others to find and kill them.
The writing is solid, and the authors avoid being preachy, the biggest trap of Christian fiction. The world is fleshed out while leaving plenty to explore in future books.
