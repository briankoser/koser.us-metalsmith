Hi, my name is Brian Koser, and I have a problem. I canâ€™t resist used book stores, used book sales, flea marketsâ€¦to be completely honest I even browse through the used books at Goodwill. ðŸ˜³ 

Sadly Melissa suffers from the same affliction. Happily we comfort each other by purchasing books. Weâ€™re up to 542 now. How do I know the exact number? Let me introduce you, fellow book-lover, to a handy little Android app: the aptly-named [Book Catalog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue). 

This app lets you create a personal database of books. Books with an ISBN barcode can be scanned in; you can also type the ISBN code or title to enter books. The other killer feature for me is that it synchronizes with [Goodreads](www.goodreads.com), the social network for readers*. With Book Catalog I can avoid coming home with a stack of books, only to realize that we already own half of them. Thatâ€™s why my August creators donation went to Philip Warner, creator of Book Catalog.
