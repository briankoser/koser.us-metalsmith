You probably don’t need Photoshop. I certainly don’t. For the basic work I do [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) is more than enough. You can work with layers, adjust colors, and do simple effects like blurs. For basic image manipulation Paint.NET is the best, and that’s why I supported it with my June creators donation.
