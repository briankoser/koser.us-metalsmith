I like alternate history, and I like American history, so {{bookdisplay|safe}} was a good combo for me. The premise is that instead of America being founded by Christians, it was founded by Satanists. The resulting world sometimes seemed over-the-top, but I kept thinking, “Well…maybe it could have happened like this?” And the author mentions writing pulp fiction in the acknowledgments, so a little over-the-top is to be expected. 😁 Most of the enjoyment for me was learning the history, seeing familiar characters in unfamiliar situations, and trying to guess identities. I actually was less interested in the plot than in reading about those “historical” details. Even so it was a page-turner and a quick read, and I’d recommend it for alternate history fans.
