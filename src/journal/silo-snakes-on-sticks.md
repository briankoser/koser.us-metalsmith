I’ve started bookmarking the interesting Wikipedia articles I stumble on. You’ll see them pop up here with the prefix “SILO”: “Stuff I Learned Online”. Enjoy the tidbits.

What’s the deal with medical organizations and snakes on sticks? Why is it sometime one snake and sometimes two snakes?

# <span class="giga">⚕</span> Rod of Asclepius

The [Rod of Asclepius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius) is a wooden rod with a single snake entwined around it. It’s a common symbol for medicine, used by entities such as the World Health Organization. Asclepius was the Greek god of medicine, son of Apollo. Why did he carry a snake on a stick? Some think it was symbolic; for example, the way snakes shed their skin could symbolize rejuvenation. 

Possibly related (although there’s no way to know), the Rod of Asclepius resembles the rod with a bronze serpent<sup>1</sup> that God told Moses to erect in the wilderness. Israelites bitten by poisonous snakes could be healed by just looking at the bronze snake. Fifteen-hundred years later, Jesus said that the snake was a picture of himself: 

<blockquote class="bible-red-letter">
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up. <i class="bible-reference milli">John 3:14</i>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="bible-red-letter">
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. <i class="bible-reference milli">John 12:32</i>
</blockquote>

# <span class="giga">☤</span> Caduceus

The [caduceus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus) is a rod with two snakes wrapped around the rod and each other. It was given to Hermes<sup>2</sup>, god of commerce and the messenger of the gods, by Apollo<sup>3</sup>, the father of Asclepius. Why did *he* carry snakes on a stick? The world is full of mysteries. The caduceus is also used by some modern organizations as a symbol of medicine, although the Rod of Asclepius is more common.

So why is the caduceus used as a medical symbol when it had no connection to medicine originally? Apparently in the late 1800’s the US military confused the two and started using the caduceus as a medical insignia. Oops.

I keep them straight in my mind by remembering that “ca<em>duce</em>us” has a “deuce” in the middle, and it’s the one with two snakes.
