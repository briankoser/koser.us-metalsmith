{{bookdisplay|raw}} was the inspiration for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie; please don’t hold that against it. (I haven’t seen the movie, but I know the only points it shares with this book are the character of Blackbeard and the main [MacGuffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin)).

Tim Powers writes some of my favorite fiction. His bailiwick is to take a historical narrative and reinterpret it in an alternate, supernatural world. Small example: in real life the pirate Blackbeard wove lit slow matches into his hair and beard to intimidate his enemies. In {{bookdisplay|raw}}, Blackbeard does this to appease a spirit who is placated by smoldering fire. It’s the blending of numerous historical facts with fictional motivations that makes Powers’s books stand out to me.

{{bookdisplay|raw}} is Powers’s re-imagining of the golden age of piracy in a world where voodoo is real. As always, his plot is fast-paced, his characters are nuanced, and the writing itself clever.

While I prefer <i class="book-title">Declare</i> and <i class="book-title">Three Days to Never</i>, {{bookdisplay|raw}} is another top-notch entry in the Tim Powers catalogue.
