If you’ve never read Tim Powers, this is the novel to start with. I love his “secret histories”, where he finds pockets of history with real-life unexplained occurrences, then gives them a fantastical explanation. I love his characters, especially in this book. His plots are twisty and fun.

{{bookdisplay|safe}} follows the adventures of Brendan Doyle, 19th-century poetry scholar. When Doyle gets stuck in 19th-century London, his efforts to survive are threatened when he’s caught in the middle of a magical intrigue.

If there’s a negative, it’s that the book is too short. Powers packs so many great ideas into his books; there were some settings and characters that I felt I didn’t get to see enough. I would have loved an additional couple hundred pages to flesh some of those out.

All of his novels I’ve read are five stars for me, so here’s my current ranking:

<ol class="no-list-type">
    <li><i class="book-title">The Anubis Gates</i>
    <li><i class="book-title">Declare</i>
    <li><i class="book-title">Three Days to Never</i>
    <li><i class="book-title">On Stranger Tides</i>
</ol>

<i>Last Call</i> is sitting on my shelf, but I’m going to try to save it for a while. We’ll see how long I can hold out.

        <li>The time travel was really well done. It’s right up there among my favorite time travel novels.
        <li>My favorite character of the book might be Horrabin. What a creep!
        <li>I really liked the ending; Doyle “regaining his free will” struck a chord for me.
