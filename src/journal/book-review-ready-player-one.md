I’m not sure what I was expecting, but I was expecting better than juvenile nerd-fantasy fan fiction.

I like science-fiction/fantasy as much as the next guy. Video games are fun; I watch movies. But it turns out that reading about characters playing video games and watching movies is not much fun. (“Neat, virtual reality, so the characters can do whatever they want…they’re playing arcade games and watching TV? 😕) Reading lists of books and movies is not fun.

The writing is not good. The author tells rather than shows. He repeats facts redundantly in his numerous lengthy sections of exposition (probably more obvious when you’re listening to an audiobook).

I did like Art3mis. And Wade is good to his friends. The plot was just interesting enough to keep me reading in case any of my complaints were resolved by the end (nope). I can’t think of anything else good to say about this book.

<details>
    <summary>Expand for spoilers</summary>
    <ul class="book-spoilers">
        <li>Wade is a jerk to people that aren’t his friends. My least favorite scene, the one that made me consider quitting, has Wade and Aech arguing (poorly) about John Hughes movies, and then being jerks to a guy that didn’t have everything about those movies memorized.
        <li>Wade just happens to make friends with Aech, the coolest and most popular egg hunter? He happens to meet and fall in love with Artemis, whom he already had a celebrity crush on? Meh.
        <li>James Halliday should not be anyone’s hero. At least he gave Wade good advice at the end.
        <li>I would have liked a little more nuanced critique on capitalism than Cline presented. Maybe he didn’t see the irony in demonizing capitalism while praising Halliday and the OASIS?
        <li>Cline did a decent job with the technical details, although he doesn’t know what “open source” is.
        <li>The big red button is interesting, although I can’t think of why Wade would ever push it, so I’m not sure of the point. I suppose if he ever wants to destroy something he doesn’t own, that provides a bunch of jobs, that is used for education, that provided him an escape from an abusive home life, where he met his only friends…
