<ol>
    <li>Open Audacity.
    <li>Plug in your mic and make sure it is being used as the input.
    <li>Press the Record button and start talking!
    <li>Press the Stop button when you are done or need to take a break.
    <li>If you want to record more, hold the <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> key and click the Record button to keep recording on the same track.
</ol>

<h3>Speaking into a microphone</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your mouth facing the mic as much as possible.
        <li>Don't speak directly into the mic; talk past it. This, together with your pop filter, will prevent plosives (puffs of air when you make certain sounds) from annoying your listeners.
        <li>Instead of filling the silence with "uh"s or "um"s, try to pause silently when thinking about what to say next. You can easily remove those pauses later.
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Save Everything</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Save the Audacity project (.aup file). This is what you'll use to edit the audio. Do this as soon as you have enough audio that you wouldn't want to have to re-record.
    <li>Export to WAV. This is your backup of the original recording. If something goes wrong during editing, you can always come back to this backup. Do this when you are done recording.
</ol>
