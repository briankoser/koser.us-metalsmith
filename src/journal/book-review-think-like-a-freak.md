If you listen to the Freakonomics podcast you can skip the book; it’s basically a “greatest hits” collection of the last couple years of episodes. Per normal for Levitt and Dubner, the content is fascinating: how did a thin Japanese man shatter a longstanding hot dog-eating record? How can you bait terrorists into revealing themselves? (The authors executed this feat with some deception in their previous book.) Why did one multinational retailer continue to spend millions on newspaper ads they knew were ineffective? This book won’t radically alter how you see the world, but it will shift it a few degrees.
