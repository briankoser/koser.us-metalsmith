<ul>
    <li>[Audacity](www.audacityteam.org) to record. It has all the features we need and it's free.
    <li>Dynamic compressor
    <li>[iTunes]() to save audio as MP3. Audacity can export to MP3, and does well for music (higher quality), but iTunes does it better for audio (smaller files).
</ul>
