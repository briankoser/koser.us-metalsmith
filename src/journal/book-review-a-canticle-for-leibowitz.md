A fascinating look at the church as preserver of knowledge post-apocalypse. Well-written, great dialogues between Christians and non-Christians that will make you think, and a very good sci-fi story to boot. Still powerful and engaging today, even without the threat of nuclear war looming. 

Other thoughts:

- It seems very plausible that the Catholic church could preserve "memorabilia" for thousands of years; I can't imagine a Protestant church or denominational group doing the same. 
- I'm inferring that no Protestants survived the nuclear war, but it could have just been outside the scope of the story.
