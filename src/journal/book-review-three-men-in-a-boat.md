If P. G. Wodehouse had written a travelogue, it would have been {{bookdisplay|safe}}. Jerome does give some history of the towns along the Thames, and waxes eloquent about the river two or three times, but the main draw here is the humor. The dry, British, tongue-in-cheek humor holds up remarkably well after 125 years.
