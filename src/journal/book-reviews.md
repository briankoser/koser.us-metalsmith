Think Like a Freak
2/29
4 stars
(Listened to audiobook) If you listen to the Freakonomics podcast you can skip the book; it's basically a greatest hits collection of the last couple years of episodes. Per normal for Levitt and Dubner, the content is fascinating: how did a thin Japanese man shatter a longstanding hot dog-eating record? How can you bait terrorists into revealing themselves? (The authors executed this feat with a chapter in their previous book.) Why did one multinational retailer continue to spend millions on newspaper ads they knew were ineffective? This book won't radically alter how you see the world, but it will shift it a few degrees.

A great introduction into behavioral economics. The authors challenge the conventional wisdom on subjects such as cheating, crime, and child rearing with a fun and engaging style. After this book, you won't just think of these topics differently; you'll *think* differently.

Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability

The seminal web usability book. Krug states at the beginning that you'll read this book and say, "I already knew that," and he's correct if you're not a beginner on the subject. One example: users should always be able to know if something is clickable (or tappable) without having to actually click or tap. Even without any earth-shattering revelations, it's a quick read with good reminders, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone in web design or development.
