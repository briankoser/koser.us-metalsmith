Did you know on Windows 8 and 10 you can hit the Windows key then start typing to search for apps, settings, and files? I’ve been using [Launchy](https://www.launchy.net/) to do just that since Windows XP. In fact, I still use Launchy, for two reasons: first, it’s faster than the Windows search on my five-year-old laptop. Second, it includes directories in its index, and I find myself searching for directories more often than files. For it’s consistent greatness, I made Launchy my September creators donation.
