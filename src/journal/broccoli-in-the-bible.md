Matthew 14:16-19
16. Then saith he unto his disciples, Give unto these provision.
17. And his disciples saith, Lord, wherewith shall we feed these? We have but five loaves, two fishes, and some broccoli.
18. The Lord saith, Give me the bread and fishes. And the disciples marvelled at his wisdom. 
19. And again he saith, Get thee behind me broccoli. Unto his disciples he saith, Let it alone: it is from the Devilâ€™s garden.

These verses mean a lot to me.
