The seminal web usability book. Krug states at the beginning that you’ll read this book and say, “I already knew that,” and he’s correct if you’re not a beginner on the subject. One example: users should always be able to see if something is clickable (or tappable) without having to actually click or tap. Even without any earth-shattering revelations, it’s a quick read with good reminders, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone in web design or development.
