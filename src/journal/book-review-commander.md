Quick, name a British naval officer. Now, name someone other than Nelson.

As with all of his contempories, Edward Pellew lived in the shadow of Nelson for much of his career. Today he is more known as a character in fictional works such as C. S. Forester’s <i class="book-title">Horatio Hornblower</i> novels than for anything he did in life. That’s unfortunate, for “the greatest seaman of his age” was an adventurous, acrobatic, tactical, accomplished man.

The book is a well-researched biography. The author’s comparisons of Pellew to Nelson are some of the most interesting sections. Taylor makes the case that the death of Pellew’s father at the age of seven defined his life. To the positive, Pellew was a loving husband, father, and brother; to the negative, he pushed his sons into a naval life as children, promoted his brother and sons beyond their abilities, and offended admirals with his constant pushing of their careers.
