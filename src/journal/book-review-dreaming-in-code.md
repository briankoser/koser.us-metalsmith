{{bookdisplay|safe}} is a glimpse at the world of computer programming, it’s culture and it’s history, through the story of Chandler, an application that was supposed to be revolutionary and ended up failing hard. Rosenberg tells the story of the team as they build Chandler, explaining terms and relating anecdotes along the way. As someone with a college degree and five years’ experience in the industry, there’s not much new information, but that didn’t lessen my enjoyment. I’d recommend this book to anyone studying software development as well as those who are just curious, “What exactly do computer programmers do?” As Dr. Donald Knuth said, “Software is hard”; by the end of {{bookdisplay|safe}} you’ll have a good grasp on why.
