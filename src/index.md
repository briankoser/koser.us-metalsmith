<section id="brian">
**Brian** is a Christian, husband, father, reader, software developer, gamer. (He has a lot of hats, but they’re all figurative.) Do you see this website? Brian built it. Do you see that tree outside? Brian likes trees. Do you see that bagel? You don’t, because Brian sneaked in and ate it. 😏

<section id="melissa">
**Melissa** is a housewife by day, taking care of a baby and keeping a house in order. By night, she’s a housewife taking care of a baby and keeping her house and husband in order. In the midst of all that, she still finds time to nerd over different things such as games, books, and tv shows.

<section id="lydia">
**Lydia** is the newest Koser, and arguably the cutest. She likes diaper changes, being carried, and all the music she’s heard. (She hasn’t heard banjo music yet, but you can’t keep your children innocent forever.) Lydia thinks naps are evil. [Poor, deluded girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISkwHlwEp0s).
