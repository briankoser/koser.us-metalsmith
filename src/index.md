    **Brian** is a Christian, husband, father, reader, software developer. (He has a lot of hats, but they‚Äôre all figurative.) Do you see this website? Brian built it. Do you see that tree outside? Brian climbed a tree once. Do you see that bagel? You don‚Äôt, because Brian already ate it. üòè

<section id="melissa">
<p>
**Melissa** is a housewife by day, taking care of a baby and keeping a house in order. By night, she‚Äôs a housewife taking care of a baby and keeping her house and husband in order. In the midst of all that, she still finds time to nerd over games, books, and tv shows.

<p>
**Lydia** is the newest Koser, and arguably the cutest. She likes diaper changes, being carried, and raspberries (the mouth-blowing thing, not the fruit).
