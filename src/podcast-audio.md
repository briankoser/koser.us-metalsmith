We have a podcast, [Ten to One](tto.koser.us). We try to make it as high-quality as possible. That applies to the content of course, but maybe just as noticeably, the audio quality and editing. As a reminder for ourselves, and for anyone else interested in audio editing, here is how the magic happens.

<ol>
    <li>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p>
            You can record audio on your smart phone or laptop, but high-quality audio requires better equipment. Each of us has:
            <ul>
                <li>Microphone
                <li>Boom arm
                <li>Pop filter
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>[Audacity](www.audacityteam.org) to record. It has all the features we need and it's free.
                <li>Dynamic compressor
                <li>[iTunes]() to save audio as MP3. Audacity can export to MP3, and does well for music (higher quality), but iTunes does it better for audio (smaller files).
            </ul>
        <p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Record</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Audacity.
                <li>Plug in your mic and make sure it is being used as the input.
                <li>Press the Record button and start talking!
                <li>Press the Stop button when you are done or need to take a break.
                <li>If you want to record more, hold the <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> key and click the Record button to keep recording on the same track.
            </ol>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Speaking into a microphone</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your mouth facing the mic as much as possible.
                <li>Don't speak directly into the mic; talk past it. This, together with your pop filter, will prevent plosives (puffs of air when you say certain letters) from making annoying sounds.
                <li>Verbal clutter ("uh", "um", etc.) is bad; try instead to pause silently if you need to think about what you're about to say. You can easily remove those pauses later.)
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Save Everything</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Save the Audacity project (.aup file). This is what you use the edit the audio. Do this as soon as you have audio that you wouldn't want to record again.
                <li>Export to WAV. This is your backup of the original recording. If something goes wrong during editing, you can always come back to this backup. Do this when you are done recording.
    </li>
