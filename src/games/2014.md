Brian didn’t start tracking our games played until March, so no data exists for January and February. Also, all but a few of the games were played by both Brian and Melissa.

## h‐index
Our h-index is <span id="hindex"></span>.

There are gamers who only play two or three games a lot; others play a lot of different games only once or twice; some play many different games many times. One way to easily spot those gamers is calculating their [h-index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): a higher index will mean people who play many games many times. For more information and to see how h-index is calculated, see [this BoardGameGeek post](boardgamegeek.com/thread/953084/whats-your-h-index).
